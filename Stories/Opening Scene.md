## Legend
Long before the tall trees grew tall, there existed a legend. A legend of a sword, and a knight. Wheresoever, the people called out for relief the knight appeared and banished darkness.  Legends of the knights bravery continued for generations after their passing, however as darkness crept back and prayers to the long gone savior went unanswered tales of the knight faded away. Replaced by new tales, of hero's bold and new. A great war brought death to the land, and the rise of a new gleaming light for the people to trust in. A final toll for the knight's legacy. And so, dear listener when you strive for greatness, remember that time erases all.
